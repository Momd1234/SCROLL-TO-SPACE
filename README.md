# SCROLL-TO-SPACE
Doomscrolling Distance Simulator is an interactive web tool that turns every swipe into a journey through the cosmos. Track how far you've scrolledâ€”from Earth to the Moon, Sun, and beyond. A creative blend of astronomy and digital mindfulness that visualizes scale and attention in a fun, educational way.
